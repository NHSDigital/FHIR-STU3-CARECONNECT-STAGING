# FHIR-STU3-CARECONNECT-STAGING

Important Announcement regarding CareConnect STU3
As of 19/09/2023, CareConnect has been deprecated and all development on the CareConnect FHIR assets has ceased.
Therefore, vendors looking to start new implementations or looking to update existing implementations should use UK Core R4 based solutions. Vendors continuing to implement CareConnect based solutions do so at their own risk and on the understanding that no maintenance or support will be available.
